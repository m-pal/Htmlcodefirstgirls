                <h2>Upskilling is your friend</h2>
                <p>Right now, millions of people across the world have been placed on furlough, made redundant, or left
                    questioning their job security. If you're lucky enough to be able to work from home right now, then
                    make the most of what would have been your commute and gain some brand new skills. If you don't want
                    to take our word for it, just click the image to see what Forbes has to say.

                    <h2>What to do if you lose your job</h2>
                    <p>No one wants to lose their job right now, but it's a reality that you need to prepare for unless
                        you're a key worker. In an emotional time we're here to help with some simple steps to start
                        with.
                        1. Find out what benefits and support you're eligible for.
                        2. Go through your budget and see what can be reduced for now.
                        3. Don't fall into a Netflix rabbit hole.
                        4. Talk to your friends, they're an invaluable support network and may be able to help you find
                        new opportunities.</p>

                    <h2>What to do when you hate networking</h2>
                    <p>In a world that discourages bragging, networking can feel like a chore, but you are awesome and
                        letting people know that can help you find an awesome new role.
                        So:
                        1. Make a master document of all your achievements so you don't have to come up with something
                        on the spot.
                        2. Draft some common interview responses and build in examples from your master list.
                        3. Ask how you can help, if you want someone to provide value to you, the best thing you can do
                        is provide value to them. This way, when you ask for a favour they're more likely to think of
                        you positively and want to help. </p>
