                <h2>Say hello to Ash</h2>
                <p>After the tragedy of the Australian bushfires in 2019, wildlife is slowly getting back to business.
                    Say
                    hello to Ash, one of the first koala joeys born since fires ravished the continent. He's a symbol a
                    hope and hopefully the first of many.

                    <h2>Coming together, at a safe distance</h2>
                    <p>With social distancing coming into force around the world (in response to COVID-19) people are
                        finding creative ways to keep traditions going. In Germany religious sites such as churches and
                        mosques remain closed, so a group of Muslims approached IKEA with a unique request -- to use
                        their
                        car park to pray on Eid al-Fitr. This allowed worshippers to come together on a holy day in a
                        safe
                        way. Flat pack kindness at its best.</p>

                <h2>Back Together Again</h2>
                <p>After 69 years together, you might think Jean and Walter Willard would want a day apart -- not a
                    chance. Last year, Jean moved into a nursing home following a fall whilst her husband lived just
                    around the corner and came to visit her every day. When COVID-19 struck, nursing homes across the US
                    were placed on lockdown and Walter was unable to visit his wife for over a month. Following health
                    issues of his own Walter asked for special permission to move into his wife's nursing home. The
                    photos of their reunion are everything, and proof that love can survive a pandemic.</p>
